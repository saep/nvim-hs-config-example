# nvim-hs-config-example

Example config reflecting the state of
[nvim-hs](https://github.com/neovimhaskell/nvim-hs).

You can (ab)use this project as a skeleton for your own configuration, for
that, simply clone this repository to the \$XDG_CONFIG_DIR directory which
is usually achieved with this command:

> git clone git@github.com:saep/nvim-hs-config-example.git ~/.config/nvim

It is assumed that you are browsing the source files, so this README is
rather short.
